import { Login } from "./login";

### Usage

Currently supporting GitHub and Apple ID by was of Google's Firebase Auth. For specific instructions on how to setup Firebase, please [review the docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

Apple ID login requires an Apple developers account.

The `firebaseConfig` object matches that of the config object Firebase will generate for you as part of the account setup process.

`Login` itself owns the responsibility of communicating with Google and managing the user's session. Provide the required two props, and you'll be off to the races.

```js
<Login
  apiUrl={...}
  firebaseConfig={{ ... }}
/>
```
