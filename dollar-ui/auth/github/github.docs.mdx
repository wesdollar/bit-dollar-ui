import { Github } from "./github";

### Usage

This component leverages Google's Firebase Authenticate using a redirect to GitHub. You will need to properly setup your Firebase account before proceeding, as you'll need the config data to pass into the component.

[Firebase Authenticate Using GitHub Setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/github-auth)

The styling of this component is opinionated, but escape hatches are provided to customize the look. To override the button styling, use prop `buttonOverride` to pass in your own component as a function (not node).

```js
<Github {...props} />
```
